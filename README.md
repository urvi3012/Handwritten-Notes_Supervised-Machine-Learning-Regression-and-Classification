# Handwritten-Notes_Supervised-Machine-Learning-Regression-and-Classification

Handwritten Notes are the way to learn concepts well and having a backup to recall concepts every time. Months back, I completed course "Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification" (course 1 of ML Specialization released in July) by Andrew Ng on Coursera and prepared lecture wise handwritten notes. These notes covers all the topics explained in the course:

1) Introduction to Machine Learning with applications
2) Supervised Vs Unsupervised Learning
3) Linear Regression Model with representation
4) Cost function and its intuition
5) Gradient Descent for linear regression (Cost function, learning rate, intuition)
6) Linear Regression with multiple variables
7) Vectorization
8) Gradient Descent for Multiple Linear Regression
9) Alternatives to Linear Regression
10) Feature Scaling and Feature engineering
11) How to choose good learning rate?
12) Polynomial Regression
13) Logistic Regression for classification
14) Decision Boundary
15) Gradient Descent for logistic regression (Cost function, learning rate, intuition)
16) Overfitting and solutions to it
17) Regularization

Sharing the notes to help those who watch the course videos and struggle in recalling the concepts. I hope it helps.
